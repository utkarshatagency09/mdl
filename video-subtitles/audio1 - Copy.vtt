PREFACE OF A YEAR
WITH THE SAINTS.

1
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.659
In presenting this work for
the first time in English,

2
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.719
address, the translator
would take the opportunity of

3
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.559
drawing the attention of the
devout American reader to

4
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.799
one or two peculiarities
in its structure which have

5
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.339
already won for it a wide
recognition among readers

6
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.669
of books of its class in

7
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.169
Europe.

8
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.139
In the first place, the
allotment of separate months

9
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.739
to individual virtues agrees
well with the practice

10
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.079
of self-examination much
recommended by many spiritual

11
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.779
writers, who advise us to take
different virtues in turn as

12
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.109
the object the special effort.

13
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.839
Nothing certainly could be
better fitted to assist us in

14
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.089
the acquisition of a virtue
than these solutions.
